Sing Sing,xraylela,0.5,This movie was slow and honestly boring in my opinion. I understand it was based on a true story and I know that has significant meaning but there are just some stories that are just not enthralling. This is one of them.

Sing Sing,homerojunior,0.5,"""Sing Sing"" se revela um manifesto enviesado, uma obra que disfarça sua mensagem sob a narrativa de redenção e transformação. O filme claramente se inclina para a perspectiva de que presidiários são ou injustiçados pelo sistema penal ou meras vítimas das circunstâncias, promovendo uma espécie de culto à personalidade destes condenados.

Sing Sing,film_purefun,1.5,《辛辛監獄劇團》3.5/10-理論上應該要是一部看完讓人為之動容的作品，但看完作品除了昏昏欲睡沒有其他的想法。作品其實到了後半部大約三分之一跟假釋有關的hearing才開始有了進入重點的感覺，其餘部分嚴重失焦而且剪輯也毫無幫助。電影的影像技巧平平無奇甚至在構圖上只能以「災難性」的呈現來形容，好多顆遠景拍舉手的場景都讓人很納悶這個攝影師到底想傳達的空間感是什麼，甚至退一萬步來說很多顆手持的呈現我都看不出來它的技術面精彩在哪，只能說看完還蠻失望的。《辛辛監獄劇團》的最大失敗點在於它對於「真實事件」的呈現與拿捏方式明顯失衡，敘述常人難以擁有的視角——服刑者，卻只顧著將服刑者與劇團排練的敘事段進行呈現而沒有對於角色的動機、心路歷程等作深入的探究，也因此作品的大部份時間都很讓人陷入一種在看拍不好的紀錄片的感覺，彷彿作品只是一再地在「呈現」發生了什麼事，而沒有努力想建構起更深刻的意象。但如果只是這樣的話還沒有什麼問題，最大的問題是整部作品的檢視角度都過於油膩，很多突如其來的自怨自艾都過於刻意，比方男主遇到的撞牆期時，電影藉由台詞的方式講出了其他服刑者也曾面臨的境遇。問題在於——為什麼作品在這進入尾聲的時候還需要藉由台詞才能讓觀影者了解這些角色的情緒呢？難道沒有辦法自然而然地讓觀影者直接共感角色所遇到的事情嗎？或許原因如同前面所述，或許這些問題都和角色動機不夠鮮明有關。也因此以這部作品的處理方式而言，僅是「呈現」，便不已足夠展現作品核心了。,25 Feb 2025,False,,

Sing Sing,derekin,2,戲劇、監獄都是一個群體，是集體的情感大熔爐，可惜編導沒有好好把握住，過於精緻 (aka客套) 的感情，反而失去真實的重量。重點是導演沒有想要解釋什麼是 RTA，它明明是一個有目標、有方法、有學術成果的計畫。不是演戲演完就算了。原本期待會是一場制度和戲劇之間的深度對話，但電影放棄了監獄的封閉感，刻意敞開不論是物理上還是角色心靈上的空間，場景好像建立在一般社區的創傷治療互助會，你可以解讀為RTA (Rehabilitation Through the Arts) 的成功，我反而因為導演試圖讓一切變得和諧而感到不安，像是參加計畫的獄友對彼此的信任度超高，團隊歡樂指數一百分，真言真情在一個高壓的環境下，真的能如此輕易交付？故事捨棄掉複雜的人性和多數囚犯的個人處境，我們只知道Divine G 和Divine Eye 想要申請假釋，其他成員彷彿只有一個目標，就是演完這齣戲。電影甚至沒有想要透過這場戲去引出個別角色真實人生的困境，連虛構和真實這種表層的對照手法，都做的得慘不忍睹。當戲和人是分開的，那何苦要一直塞給觀眾一堆順暢到不行的排練呢？畢竟這些排練的成果最終也沒有反饋到舞台上，你可以透過排練去談角色的過去，為什麼進來、進來前的生活、想不想出去，心裡有沒有不甘、悔恨、委屈，進一步挖掘角色對未來的想像，思索生命的意義；也可以把重心放在角色間的的友情如何建立，揭露大家對彼此真實的想法，可能有衝突、猜疑，但也有合作；或去探索角色們為了演戲做出什麼努力，成員們加入計畫前後的轉變。至少可以談談大家對主角排練到一半搞自閉的心情吧？你可以用輕鬆的方法談、用結構的方法談，但絕對不是用想像力遊戲敷衍地談、告訴觀眾我懶得深入，他們大部分的人都過得得不錯，有困境都可以自體克服，而且大家最後一定會和好，您別瞎操心了。常人說戲劇最動人的是戲假情真，難得遇到一個故事戲真情假，戲中戲的骨肉和形式都很零碎，連一小段完整的走位都無法再現給觀眾看，個人非常困惑編導對 RTA 的理解，把一齣舞台劇搞得像辦家家酒一樣簡單，不用大量的溝通、內在重整、進行生活重建，只要照幾次鎂光燈、講幾句觀眾不知道脈絡的臺詞、演幾個符號化的經典角色，就可以完成行為的修正、心靈的救贖。最好是這麼容易。抓狂演訓班好太太太太太多了。,02 Mar 2025,False,,

Sing Sing,funkyfrankie,3.5,I love the arts. Watching these former inmates essentially tell their own stories is truly a special experience. That alongside a powerful performance from Colman Domingo makes for a very tragic and tender film. I can’t help but think that the film feels just a tad like awards bait but despite the overwhelmingly manipulative music I think the film has too much heart to fully call it that. It definitely is resonating more with others than myself but that’s okay!

And while I don’t think this is the one that will break him out to the masses, it did emphasize how damn good he is. Also, producer/actor Clarence “Divine Eye” Maclin is a surprise force who manages to hold his own with Domingo. Beautifully touching portrait of rebuilding oneself from the inside.[Screening followed by a special appearance and Q&A with director/co-writer Greg Kwedar, producer Monique Walton, stars Clarence “Divine Eye” Maclin, Sean “Dino” Johnson, and Paul Raci]",03 May 2024,True,,

Extraordinarily raw and human, a story about life, loss, and growth in all its many forms, be that physical, mental, or emotional. Connection drives everything here as it explores the ways in which incarceration boxes people in and how art can and does change our realities. The already powerful message is made that much more tangible by the cast, most of whom were inmates themselves at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility and participated in the Rehabilitation Through the Arts program while there.
